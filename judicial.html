<p>
The Judicial Branch of Texas is responsible for interpreting state law, ensuring
justice is administered fairly, and protecting constitutional rights through
independent courts.
</p>

<p>
Judges and justices operate separately from the executive and legislative
branches, maintaining judicial independence while upholding the rule of law.
